## üó£ About

The word ‚ÄúPiscine‚Äù is the French word for ‚Äúswimming pool‚Äù: dive into the deep end of coding, and learn how to swim - together with your peers. The Piscine is a four week long trial period. During the Piscine, you will discover the basics of coding from scratch. No prerequisites of any kind are needed: no previous degrees, no coding experience. This period will be very intensive and requires commitment. There is no fixed amount of applicants to be selected. This means there is no competition between applicants and anyone can be selected.

These exercises teach you the basics of writing C programs. Learn how to use the shell to manage files, compile your code and execute your programs. Through simple functions in the beginning, to your first programs, you'll learn the C syntax and logic of programming in general.

Alongside working on these exercises, the Piscine included exams, events and peer-meetings.
